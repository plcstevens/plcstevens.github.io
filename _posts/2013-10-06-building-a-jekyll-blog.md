title: Building a Jekyll blog
layout: posts

Interesting
===========

Using a git aware blogging system is very powerful, changes can be ```observed``` and ```worked``` on at will.

{% highlight ruby %}
def method_name
  @instance_variable = "string"
  @instance_variable.each_char do |c|
    puts c
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

In the future I'll hopefully be able to move away from this default/forked layout into something I have
created myself. This will likely require learning and using more CSS. Never a bad thing!
